# Commercial Use of Astron Social
Astron Social is released under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3).

# âœ… What You Can Do
You are free to use, modify, and self-host Astron Social for personal, educational, or internal purposes, as long as you comply with the terms of the AGPLv3 license.

You may redistribute modified or unmodified versions of the software, but you must provide public access to the source code â€” including if you deploy it as a network service (e.g., a hosted social platform).

# ðŸš« What Requires a Commercial License
You must contact Astron Technologies and obtain a commercial license if you intend to:

- Launch Astron Social as a commercial or public-facing SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), whether free or paid.

- Integrate Astron Social into a larger commercial platform, app suite, or enterprise solution.

- Use Astron Social in a business environment without open-sourcing your changes and dependencies (as required by AGPLv3).

- Seek to bypass AGPLv3 obligations or need a proprietary license.

# ðŸ§¾ Why a Commercial License?
We believe in sustainable open-source development and fair use. A commercial license:

- Lifts the AGPLv3 copyleft requirements.

- Enables private or proprietary use, including closed-source SaaS deployments.

- May include access to premium modules, features, or integrations (if/when available).

- Provides priority support and enterprise onboarding.
